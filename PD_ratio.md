## PD ratio -- used to measure a trading system

Performance is measured using the profit drawdown ratio, which we will call the PD ratio for short. It is related to the Calmar Ratio and is defined as:

* the net profit divided by the maximum drawdown of profit/loss (not returns) when the strategy has made a profit;
* the net loss when the stratagy has made a loss (or zero profit).

PD ratio is the result of dividing the net profit by the maximum drawdown of the system. It measures how quickly the system recovers from drawdowns. Obviously the higher this ratio, the better the system we are using.
